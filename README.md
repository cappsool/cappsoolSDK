CappsoolLiteSDK integration guide for iOS

1. Obtain an Integration key from Cappsool
2. add CappsoolLiteSDK.framework to your XCode Project (drag and drop)
3. Go to Project Settings -> General -> Linked Frameworks and Libraries and add AdSupport.framework
4. Open info.plist and paste these lines (if not there earlier):

```
    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
```

5. In <your>AppDelegate.m, add the bold lines:

```
#import <CappsoolLiteSDK/CappsoolLiteSDK.h>
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
...
[[CSServer sharedInstance] putIntegrationKey:@"<Your integration key>"];
...
}
```

6. In your view controller, in the desired location, create an instance of CSAdView and add it to the view. For example:

```
#import <CappsoolLiteSDK/CappsoolLiteSDK.h>

@interface ViewController () 
...
@property (strong) CSAdView *csAdView;
@end

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    CSAdView* csAdView = [[CSAdView alloc] init];
    self.csAdView = csAdView;
    
    // Positions the ad at the bottom, with the correct size
    self.csAdView.frame = CGRectMake(0, self.view.bounds.size.height - 380, self.view.bounds.size.width, 380);
    [self.view addSubview:self.csAdView];
    
    // Loads the ad over the network
    [self.csAdView load:@"<Size and Location description>"];

}
```
7. Size and Location Description should be letters only string. For example: mainScreenBottomBanner, listItemMedium, etc. These text will later help us configure the appearance of the ad through Cappsoolâ€™s servers. 
8. CSAdView size should generally span the entire width of the device (portrait mode) and have an height of:
- 380px : large ad, suitable for a list  or a scroll view
- 240px : medium ad, suitable as a big banner or in a list or a scroll view
- 100px/80px : banner, or small list item
